# Continuous-Deployment-of-Cloud-Native-Applications

This is the code repository for [Continuous Deployment of Cloud-Native Applications [Video]](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/application-development/continuous-deployment-cloud-native-applications-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.


 


## About the Video Course

Businesses today are evolving so rapidly that having their own infrastructure to support their expansion is not feasible. As a result, they have resorted to using the elasticity of the cloud to provide a platform to build and deploy their highly scalable applications. 

This video is your one-stop shop to learn all about deployment and monitoring of Cloud-native applications on various cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Docker. You’ll start by understanding the Docker concepts, then move on to deploying an application on Docker. Next, we’ll build the application infrastructure on AWS. After that, we’ll deploy and monitor an application on it. Finally, we’ll architect the application infrastructure using Azure and look at deploying and monitoring an application on it.

This video will teach you how to craft applications that are built as small standard units, using all the proven best practices and avoiding the usual traps. It's a practical video, where we create VMs, then deploy our applications on them. The video will take you on a journey, the destination of which is the creation of VMs and deployment over the cloud platforms.
